## Project context
Building a complete data preprocessing and predictive classification model pipeline aimed at forecasting whether a company will cease operations within the next two years. The data was collected and curated by Bisnode, a European company specializing in business information. The dataset spans from 2005 to 2016 and encompasses companies across various sectors of the economy (such as electronics, electrical equipment, engines, etc.) and services (food, beverages, and lodging). Companies with revenue exceeding 100 million Euros were anonymized to minimize identification possibilities.
